# 🎲 Probability in Action: Predicting the Unpredictable!

This is an interactive web project designed to simulate **coin tosses** and **dice rolls**, helping users understand **basic probability** through hands-on experimentation.

## 📌 Project Overview

- 🔄 **Coin Toss Simulator** – Toss a virtual coin and track how many times it lands on Heads or Tails.
- 🎲 **Dice Roll Simulator** – Roll a 6-sided die and observe the frequency of each number.
- 📊 **Live Charts** – Real-time bar charts update after each event to visualize the probability.
- 🔉 **Sound Effects** – Click actions play a sound (if browser permits).
- 🧠 **Educational Purpose** – Ideal for math expos, classrooms, or anyone learning about randomness and statistics.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) (for rendering interactive charts)

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

1. **Download or unzip** the folder.
2. Open the file `index.html` in your browser (preferably Chrome).
3. Click the buttons to **toss the coin** or **roll the dice**.
4. Observe the **scoreboard**, **recent history**, and **live probability charts**.
5. Optionally, use the **Reset** buttons to restart the simulation.

> ⚠️ If the sound doesn't play, check that your browser allows auto-play for media after user interaction.

## 📚 Learning Outcomes

- Understand **the law of large numbers**.
- Observe how outcomes vary in the **short term vs. long term**.
- Learn how **charts** can represent real-time data visually.

## 🎯 Real-Life Applications

- Teaching aid in **schools and colleges**.
- Probability-based thinking in **games, predictions, finance**, and more.
- Demo tool for **interactive math exhibits** or science fairs.
